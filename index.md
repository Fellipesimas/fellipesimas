Recently I obtained my Bachelor degree (Bs) at the [Pontifícia Universidade Católicas de Minas Gerais](https://www.pucminas.br/destaques/Paginas/default.aspx) advised by [Eugênio Batista Leite](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eug%C3%AAnio-batista-leite-4310b670/) MSc. During my Biological Sciences undergraduate course, I was also member of [Triatomíneos](http://www.cpqrr.fiocruz.br/pg/pesquisa/grupos-de-pesquisa/22-2/) research laboratory at Fiocruz Minas, in which I was advised by Dr. [Liléia Diotaiuti](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lileia-Diotaiuti) and Dr. [Rita de Cássia Moreira](http://www.cpqrr.fiocruz.br/pg/team_member/rita-de-cassia-moreira-de-souza-2/). 

I am currently studying an invasive species of Cnidarian called 'Cordylophora caspia,' and I am developing a research project on its geographic distribution and niche modeling. My research interests encompass invasive species, anthropogenic impacts on the environment, ocean acidification, climate change, and ecology. I am a Msc Student in Zoology at [Federal University of Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/) (UFMG) and I am being advised by Dr. [Lucília Souza Miranda](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucilia-Souza-Miranda), in the biology and cnidaria evolution lab. 

My native language is portuguese but I have studied english for 5 years during the high school, and I also studied japanese at the basic level. Also during the high school, I made a computer technician course, so I am a little bit used to html, css and some computer basics. Because of my big interest on marine biology, on 2019 I acquired a Scuba Diving Cerfication by PADI [(Open Water Diver)](https://www.padi.com/courses/open-water-diver?utm_campaign=ww-en-entry-pros-search-seekadventure&utm_source=google.com&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=ww-en-entry-pros-search-open_water_diver&crid=618705881&gclid=Cj0KCQiAys2MBhDOARIsAFf1D1cLQ-XNde-q6qHI4Da11xG527x7oixgR749vZ-eLyt4LI55FckGnJEaAsD5EALw_wcB).

## Work Experience

- 2023 - Current - CERN (Consultoria e Empreendimentos de Recursos Naturais Ltda.)
- I work in the biotic field, assisting with environmental licensing and contributing to the development and/or revision of technical reports required for the environmental licensing process. These reports include PRADA (Environmental Impact Assessment Plan), PECF (Forest Management Plan), PIA (Environmental Impact Study), as well as reports on the monitoring of fauna and flora. I also contribute to terrestrial and aquatic fauna rescue programs.

- 2022 - 2022 - Turismo Estudantil Viagens Acadêmicas Ltda. 
- Participation in guided tours with students of varying age groups, ranging from elementary to high school. I serve as a biologist, actively engaging in fieldwork with educational objectives.

- 2018 - 2019: Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
- Assisting with supplementary studies through tutoring in the course "Invertebrate Non-Coelomate Animals" for the 1st semester, and "Biology of Phanerogams" for the 3rd semester of the Biological Sciences program. All tutoring sessions were conducted in the institution's laboratory, making use of various practical teaching tools, in addition to laboratory organization and equipment preparation for student use.


- 2018 - 2019: Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Brazil.
- All activities were directed towards the execution of the research project titled: "Assessment of domestic infestation by triatomines in the municipality of Espinosa, Minas Gerais." Tasks included cleaning of the triatomine colonies, DNA extraction, PCR, electrophoresis, literature research through online platforms, and the composition of scientific documents.


- 2017 - 2018: INOT - Instituto de observação da terra (Earth Observation Institute), Brazil.
- INOT (Earth Observation Institute) is a NGO that aims the species' conservation at Serra do Cipó and Serra do Espinhaço National Parks through research and environmental education projects. All the activities performed were associated with the Environmental Education project titled "Ecomuseum of Espinhaço: Interpretative Trails in the Serra do Cipó National Park." These activities involved transcribing recorded interviews, reviewing literature on Environmental Education, the Espinhaço Range, and the biodiversity of Serra do Cipó. Additionally, I assisted in creating materials for scientific outreach, which were used in social media publications and on the INOT website.
