I am currently pursuing my Doctorate degree (3rd year) at the [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) advised by Dr. [Kazuhiro Fukui](http://www.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kfukui/english/indexE.html). I am a member of the [Computer Vision Laboratory](https://home.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp). 

My research topics invole natural language processing, computer vision and pattern recognition. More specifically, my main line of study is the investigation of subspace based-methods and its applications on word embedding.

I also enjoy developing applications involving robotics and electronics.
